# Sudon't

A puzzle before you scroll.

Sudon't is a browser extension that adds a small, friendly pause before you
open distracting websites. Instead of the page loading instantly, you're
asked to solve a quick Sudoku puzzle first. Once you finish it, you can:

- enter the site with a limited block of scrolling time,
- play another Sudoku instead,
- do a crossword instead, or
- explain in a few sentences why you need extra time, and grant yourself a
  few more minutes.

When your time runs out, the pause returns. A short reflection log keeps
track of every time you granted yourself extra minutes and why, so you can
see your own patterns.

## Why it works

- The puzzle interrupts the automatic "open app, start scrolling" reflex
  without blocking you outright.
- Writing out *why* you need more time turns an impulsive click into a
  deliberate decision.
- You're always in control: leave anytime, add or remove sites, and adjust
  puzzle difficulty and unlock duration from the settings page.

## Privacy

Sudon't doesn't collect, transmit, or sell any data. Everything (your site
list, settings, and reflection log) is stored locally in your browser using
the standard extension storage API.

## Permissions

| Permission | Why it's needed |
|---|---|
| `storage` | Save your site list and settings locally |
| `tabs` | Detect when you navigate to a site you've chosen to pause |
| `alarms` | Track when your unlocked time expires |
| `scripting` | Inject the pause screen only on sites you've explicitly granted access to |
| Host permissions (optional, per-site) | Granted one site at a time; nothing is monitored beyond what you add to your list |

## Development

Requires [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org)
(`magick` on `PATH`) for icon generation.

```sh
pnpm install
```

Drop a 128x128 PNG at `icons/icon-128.png`, then:

```sh
pnpm build   # generates icons, type-checks, bundles, and copies static files into dist/
pnpm zip     # zips dist/ into sudont.zip for store submission
```

Load `dist/` as an unpacked extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions`,
enable Developer mode, "Load unpacked") or in Firefox
(`about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, "Load Temporary Add-on").

## Publishing an existing release

Run the **publish-stores** workflow from the GitHub Actions page. Enter an
existing GitHub release tag and select Firefox, Chrome, or both. The workflow
downloads that release's ZIP files and submits them for store review without
rebuilding from source or comparing their contents. For Chrome, the workflow
rewrites the manifest to use a background service worker and repackages the ZIP
without source maps. Firefox receives the GitHub release notes and source
archive as part of its submission. Chrome does not provide an API for release notes, so
the GitHub release remains its changelog.

Create a `browser-stores` GitHub environment with these secrets:

- `AMO_JWT_ISSUER` and `AMO_JWT_SECRET`, from the Firefox Add-ons API keys page.
- `CHROME_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`, for a Google service account linked to the
  Chrome Web Store publisher account. Grant the service account
  `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` on itself so it can create access
  tokens. Enable the Chrome Web Store API in its Google Cloud project.

Add `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID` and `CHROME_PUBLISHER_ID` as environment variables.
The extension listings must already exist in both stores. Store review and
approval still happen after the workflow completes.

## License

TBD.
